# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Commitment

Bayou Help serves vulnerable populations, and security is critical. We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them responsibly:

### Option 1: GitHub Security Advisories (Preferred)
1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/SilverWulf212/bayou_help/security) of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the advisory form with details

### Option 2: Email
If you prefer email, contact the maintainers directly through GitHub.

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Type of vulnerability**: XSS, SQL injection, authentication bypass, etc.
- **Affected component**: Which part of the app (client, server, specific file)
- **Steps to reproduce**: Detailed steps to trigger the vulnerability
- **Potential impact**: What could an attacker do?
- **Suggested fix**: If you have ideas (optional)
- **Your contact info**: How we can reach you for follow-up

### Response Timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix timeline**: Depends on severity (see below)

## 🎯 Severity Levels

### Critical (Fix within 24-48 hours)
- Unauthorized access to admin functions
- Data exposure of user information (if any exists)
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass

### High (Fix within 1 week)
- XSS vulnerabilities
- CSRF vulnerabilities
- Sensitive information disclosure
- Privilege escalation

### Medium (Fix within 2 weeks)
- Rate limiting issues
- Denial of service vulnerabilities
- Information leakage

### Low (Fix within 1 month)
- Minor security improvements
- Security best practice violations

## 🔐 Security Features

### Current Security Measures

1. **No User Data Storage**
   - No user accounts or authentication
   - No PII (personally identifiable information) stored
   - Session data not persisted

2. **Admin Protection**
   - Admin panel secured with password authentication
   - Rate limiting on admin endpoints
   - Environment-based credentials (not hardcoded)

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - API rate limits to prevent abuse
   - Configurable per-IP limits

4. **Input Validation**
   - Server-side validation on all endpoints
   - Sanitized user inputs

5. **Privacy Features**
   - Quick exit button for safety
   - No logging of user queries (planned)
   - No tracking or analytics on user activity

6. **CORS Configuration**
   - Restricted cross-origin requests
   - Configurable allowed origins

### Planned Security Enhancements

- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- [ ] HTTPS enforcement
- [ ] Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- [ ] Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Regular security audits

## 🚧 Known Limitations

1. **Default Admin Password**: The application includes a default fallback password (`bayou-admin-2024`). **This MUST be changed via environment variables in production.**

2. **HTTP in Development**: Development mode uses HTTP. Production deployments should use HTTPS.

3. **Basic Authentication**: Admin authentication is simple password-based. Consider implementing more robust auth for high-security deployments.

## ⚠️ Security Best Practices for Deployers

If you're deploying Bayou Help, please:

1. **Set Strong Passwords**
   ```bash
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-very-strong-random-password
   ```

2. **Use HTTPS**
   - Never deploy without TLS/SSL in production
   - Use Let's Encrypt or your hosting provider's SSL

3. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm update
   ```

4. **Configure Rate Limits**
   - Adjust rate limits based on your expected traffic
   - Monitor for abuse patterns

5. **Secure Your Server**
   - Keep OS and Node.js updated
   - Use a firewall
   - Limit exposed ports
   - Regular security patches

6. **Monitor Logs**
   - Set up log monitoring
   - Alert on suspicious patterns
   - Retain logs appropriately (without user PII)

7. **Backup Regularly**
   - Back up resource data
   - Have a disaster recovery plan

## 🔍 Security Checklist for Contributors

Before submitting code that handles:

- [ ] User input → Validate and sanitize
- [ ] Admin functions → Require authentication
- [ ] External data → Validate and sanitize
- [ ] File uploads → Check type and size
- [ ] Database queries → Use parameterized queries (when implemented)
- [ ] Environment variables → Document required variables
- [ ] API endpoints → Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Error messages → Don't leak sensitive info
